SDL 2.0 Programming
=============

This project is a collection of examples related to SDL 2.0 programming.
The goal is to implement a multi-platform SDL sample project.
It handles Game, multimedia, and utility related code.

By using C/C ++ as the main language, 
we aim to write code that will survive long without being dependent on the platform and OS over time.

Windows - Visual Studio 2017
Android -  ADT-20131030

For Android, we plan to change the IDE to Android Studio later.
